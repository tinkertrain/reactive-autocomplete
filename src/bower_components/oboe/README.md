**Oboe.js** helps web applications respond quicker by baking streawming into http's request-response
model.
It glues a transport that sits **somewhere between streaming and downloading** 
to a **JSON parser that sits somewhere between SAX and
DOM**.
It is small enough to be a [micro-library](http://microjs.com/#), doesn't have any 
dependencies and doesn't care which other libraries you need it to speak to.

Oboe makes it really easy to start using json from a response before the ajax request completes. 
Or even if it never completes.
